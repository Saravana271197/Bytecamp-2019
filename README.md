NextGen bot

We have seen many remotely controlled bots that are currently and has been in action for sometime now, but they are controlled mostly by Bluetooth devices on small scale and for large scale purposes radio frequencies are used, we have also seen bots in defence that are controlled by mobile controller that constantly moves and henceforth widening the control area, the uniqueness in this project bot which we have made is it can be controlled via internet and we have features which enables us to control it through our action gestures, our main purpose making this project was to mitigate human interventions where there is a danger of life situations, also to travel without any distant restraints. We have built this bot with microcontroller NodeMCUs as a connector and signal processor, we have used potentieter and arm prosthetics for motion gestures which when moved is interconnected with nodeMCU, the major and most important part of our project is the use of cloud as a medium for communicating controller and bot by using Firebase as a SAAS.
